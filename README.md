## Eating Disorder Management Application
***RecoverED*** is an application with tools to aid in the process of managing an eating disorder. 
Catered towards those in the recovery phase from eating disorders and those seeking to foster
a healthier relationship with food and overall well-being, the application features meal-tracking software
enabling users to input information about their daily meals and thoughts. Additionally, it includes a check-in 
journal for monitoring recovery progress and setting goals, along with a weight log. 


My interest in this project stems from the observation that while numerous health and food-related applications 
exist, very few specifically address the cultivation of a positive relationship with food and weight. 
There is a scarcity of options for individuals seeking software tailored to this purpose. 
The eating disorder recovery process involves various tasks that necessitate tracking and documentation, 
and the application aims to optimize these processes electronically. 
In doing so, it seeks to address a widespread issue that the tech industry has largely overlooked.
